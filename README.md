# SteamStatsDiscordBot
This is a bot I am working on that pulls information from Steam, OpenDota, and maybe others in the future to give information.
## Commands
`!ping` to see if the bot is online.

`!help` to see available commands.

`!herostats <hero-id>` to see hero stats.

`!dotaprofile <steam id (custom or not)>` to get basic dota info.

`!csgostats <steam id (custom or not)>` to get csgo info.

`!banstatus <steam id (custom or not)>` to get ban info.

## Anti-Spam
The bot only accepts commands every 5 seconds for each user, so multiple people can send 1 command each within 5 seconds, but a single person can't send commands more than 1 per 5 seconds.
